			    <H3>The world of academic research is complex and not always straightforward.
				It can be fun, but the reality is that it also frustrating and discouraging at times.
				My mentoring philosophy is to accompany the member of my lab towards their goals, whichever they are.
				My biggest reward would be to see my mentees enjoying their project and thriving in their future career.
				I commit to be there to support this goal.
				In exchange I ask good work and science ethics standards, dedication to your project, and that you keep me informed if you encounter any difficulty.
				Communication is key.   	
				<BR><BR>


				Please find below some more details regarding my Research and Mentoring Philosophies.
				These are regularly updated and I welcome any feedback.</H3>

			I am passionated by science. I love solving problems and thinking outside the box.
			<BR><BR>

			If you made it here through my website, you probably realized that I am a multi-disciplinary researcher.
			This means that I am not a world expert in any field, but I know enough in a lot of fields.
			If you come to me as a mentee, I may not have all the answers to your questions, but I promise that I will work with you to find the answer you are looking for.
			<BR><BR>

			While publishing in high-impact journals is great, it this is not an objective in my lab.
			Integrity in research is what I value the most.
			I want to be proud of my work and I want the same for my mentees.
			I aim for honest, sound and transparent science.
			This is the foundation of my research.

			The role of a mentor is to help their mentee achieve their goals.
			This is why I always establish a dialogue with the personnel or students I supervise to better understand where they want to go with their professional or academic career and how I can better assist them in reaching their goals.
			<BR><BR>
			
			My mentoring philosophy is also based on collaboration.
			For example, I expect experienced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the lab to participate in the  mentorship of those who start, and potentially collaborate in publications where appropriate.
			Because my work heavily relies on modern computational tools, I also exepct that HQPs will interact and share codes using the Ocean Access Research Lab GitHub page.
			<BR><BR>

			In terms of mentorship, I think that balancing autonomy and empowerment with frequent follow ups and milestones is key for success.
			As a lab member, you can expect regular weekly or bi-weekly one-on-one meetings with me.
			During those meetings, I expect you, the mentee, to prepare the agenda, lead the discussion and follow up on previous Action Items.
			The rest of the time my door is always open for discussion outside the regular schedule.
			<BR><BR>
			
			Challenges related to Equity, Diversity and Inclusion are common in Academia, where ideas and metrics of excellence are often dominated by the western culture.
			I have my own biases myself.
			As a new scholar, I am committed to creating an equitable, inclusive and diverse working environment.
			<BR><BR>

			Because each HQP may have different goals, managing expectations is also an important aspect to consider for successful relationships between mentor and mentees.
			Mutual expectations may differ based on past experiences, personality or cultural background.
			Awareness regarding those differences is essential and will be discussed with any student interested in joining the lab. 
			<BR><BR>
			
			In my lab, we will have regular meetings, and I will make sure that communication is key and that everyone is listened to.
			I will also make sure that everyone is aware that productivity metrics or expression of excellence are not the same for everyone and that diverse points of view and learning approaches exist.
			Cultural differences and references are assets in a team.

			Please get in touch if you have any question, comment or concern!
